## [Unreleased]

### Added — Ongoing Audit System (2026-05-21 PM)
- **`scripts/audit/`** — modular reality-check system
  - 10 independent checks (imports, endpoints, files, tests, todos, deps, schemas, docs, orphans, migrations)
  - HTML + JSON + console reporters
  - History snapshots with auto-diff vs previous run
  - Suppression mechanism with mandatory expiry dates (no permanent lies)
- **`.github/workflows/audit.yml`** — runs on push, PR, daily cron, manual trigger
  - PR comment with severity counts
  - Full HTML report uploaded as artifact
- **`scripts/audit/README.md`** — architecture + how to add new checks
- **Bugs caught on first run:**
  - Silent `try/except Exception` in `apps/api/main.py` was hiding broken `maxillm_routes` import — MAXILLM continuous learning routes were silently never registering. Removed the silent except, fixed root cause.
  - `forgesight.cad.__init__` imported `ExportFormat` from `cadowl.core.exporter` but the symbol was never defined. Added the `ExportFormat` enum.
- **Down from 36 errors → 0 errors** after fixes + tuned suppressions.

### Added — Auth Everywhere + Postgres Scaffold (2026-05-21 PM)
- **`apps/api/auth_deps.py`** — reusable Depends() helpers (`perm()`, `role()`, `any_role()`)
- **Auth wired on every route** via `dependencies=[Depends(perm(Permission.X))]`
  - 23 routes in `apps/api/main.py` (projects, sites, floors, maps, devices, zones, cables, imports, events, snapshots, rollback)
  - 17 routes in `apps/api/lifecycle_routes.py` (sites, designs, sandbox, dashboard)
  - `lifecycle_router` now mounted at `/api/v1/lifecycle/*` (was floating)
  - Health (`/api/v1/health`) and metrics (`/metrics`) stay anonymous for k8s/Prom
- **`tests/integration/test_auth_enforcement.py`** — 9 tests verifying 401 with DEV_MODE off, 200 for health/metrics
- **`tests/conftest.py`** — forces `CADOWL_DEV_MODE=true` for tests (was env-fragile)
- **`packages/db/`** — first real database layer
  - `session.py` — async SQLAlchemy 2.x engine + sessionmaker + FastAPI dep
  - `models.py` — 14 ORM models (Project, Site, Floor, Map, Device, Zone, Cable, ImportBatch, Event, Snapshot, IdempotencyKey, SiteExtended, Design, SandboxConfig)
  - Portable types (Uuid auto-converts PG ↔ SQLite)
  - `README.md` — full DB ops guide
- **`alembic.ini` + `packages/db/migrations/`** — Alembic config + async env.py + initial migration
- **`scripts/migrate.py`** — convenient migration runner
- 4 new DB tests, all green (model import + CRUD + unique constraint + JSON round-trip)

### Added — Production Hardening (2026-05-21 AM)
- **`packages/integrations/`** — first-class home for external system clients
  - `doris` — async client with TTL cache, retry, pydantic-settings
  - `saone` — async camera health client with bulk register
  - `grafana` — async switch telemetry + camera-to-port diagnosis
  - `axis` — Site Designer JSON importer with coverage polygons
  - `gis` — OSM geocoding + building footprint + GPS mapping
  - `master` — correlation bridge across all of the above
  - 13 new tests, all green
- **Containerization**
  - Production multi-stage `Dockerfile` (non-root user, healthcheck, layer caching)
  - `docker-compose.yml` with api + worker + postgres + redis
  - Comprehensive `.dockerignore`
- **`apps/worker/`** — first async worker (Arq + Redis)
  - DXF parsing job (stub)
  - Saone health sync job
  - Grafana network sync job
  - Master Bridge dashboard build job
- **`apps/api/middleware.py`** — observability layer
  - `X-Request-ID` generation + propagation
  - Structured logging with request context
  - Per-request timing
  - `/metrics` endpoint (Prometheus)
- **`apps/api/infrastructure_routes.py`** — HTTP endpoints for the master bridge
  - `GET /api/v1/infrastructure/health/{store}` — Saone camera summary
  - `GET /api/v1/infrastructure/network/{store}` — Grafana switch summary
  - `GET /api/v1/infrastructure/diagnose/{store}/{ip}` — auto-diagnosis
  - `POST /api/v1/infrastructure/dashboard/{store}` — full master view
- **`infra/k8s/`** — Kubernetes manifests for AI Innovation Lab
  - Namespace, ConfigMap, Secret template
